        <h2 id="little" class="title">A little about myself</h2>
        <p> My education background is in Psychology and Global Mental Health. I love understanding human beahviours. I worked in the field for a few years and now I am looking to change to a new field.</p>

      <h2 id="beginning" class="title">The beginning!</h2>
      <p> I am a complete beginner to coding. I never really cared much for technology. Quiet frankly, I thought that it was not for me because I see myself entirely as a social being who is more interested in human beings and computers. Over the past ten years, I have been working and studying in the public health field. Never found satisifaction in this field. I have been rather disappointed because it did not really meet my expectations. I have also learnt that it is really much harder to have a tangible impact in people's lives than I previousily thought. So, I decided that I want to do something different. Something that does not require emotional energy. I just wanted to give coding a chance, why not? Its not like I have several other options waiting for me. 
      <p> I decided to learning to code because I am exploring a new work field.  I am really enjoying it. I have been learning for the past two weeks or so. </p>
      <p> First I just tried an introductory course on Code academy, then free code</p>
